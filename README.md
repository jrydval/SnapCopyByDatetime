SnapCopyByDatetime
==================

Copy files from a camera upload directory to directories organized by creation date

I am using the script together with Fujifilm PCAutoSave utility to transfer snaps from a Fujifilm camera over Wi-fi and to copy the snaps from PCAutoSave upload directory to a directory tree organized by snaps creation date.
