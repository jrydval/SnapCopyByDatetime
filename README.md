SnapCopyByDatetime
==================

Copy files from a camera upload directory to directories organized by creation date

I am using the script together with Fujifilm PCAutoSave utility to copy the snaps from PCAutoSave upload directory to a directory tree organized by snaps creation date.

The script uses EXIFr library to read creation date from the snaps and copies the snaps into directory named by date.
